            2.0 FSI of 150 horsepower – The same 2.0 ALT, only with added FSI system. Decent in power and reliability, but it only rolls about using 98 petrol, and the LPG installations only work in 70% gas and 30% petrol, never 100% gas. Plus, if you put an LPG tank in the already tiny trunk of the A4 B6, you will only have room for 1 CD with Tom Jones and that’s about it.
